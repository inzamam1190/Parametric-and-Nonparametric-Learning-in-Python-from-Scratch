# Parametric-and-Nonparametric-Learning-in-Python-from-Scratch
The objective of this project is, first of all, to learn how to implement the two types of learning algorithms based on Baysian decision theory, namely, parametric learning and non-parametric learning. In parametric learning, I will implement the three cases of discriminant functions assuming Gaussian pdf. In non-parametric learning, I will implement kNN. Equally important, the second objective is to get familiar with the design flow when applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.
